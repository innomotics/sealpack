# Extend the base (this) configuration. When you extend a configuration
# the base rules take precendence over the extended rules. I.e, if there are
# duplicate rules in both the base configuration and the extended configuration
# the base rules will override the extended rules.
# Another thing to know with extending configurations is you can chain together
# multiple configuration files to a depth of 2. Allowlist arrays are appended
# and can contain duplicates.
# useDefault and path can NOT be used at the same time. Choose one.
[extend]
# useDefault will extend the base configuration with the default gitleaks config:
# https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml

# or you can supply a path to a configuration. Path is relative to where gitleaks
# was invoked, not the location of the base config.
